## About

This project is a fully-featured web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). It is designed with security best practices in mind, ensuring that user data is handled safely and securely.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication with JWT, CSRF and OAuth integration.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for users and administrators.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure integration with Stripe for payment processing.
- **Real-Time Features**: Includes socket-based real-time notifications and updates.
- **Content Management**: Easily manage content through an integrated CMS.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Version 16.x or higher
- **npm**: Version 7.x or higher
- **MongoDB**: Ensure you have a running MongoDB instance or Atlas Cluster

### Installation

1. **Fork the Repository**:

   Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   Use the following command to clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-forked-repo.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd your-forked-repo
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:

   You need to install dependencies for both the frontend and backend. Navigate to each directory and run `npm install`.

   - **Frontend**:

     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install
     ```

   - **Backend**:

     ```bash
     cd ../server
     npm install
     ```

### Environment Variables

You need to set up `.env` files for both the frontend and backend to properly configure the project. Follow these steps:

1. **Frontend Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory and include the following variables:

   ```bash
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   VITE_APP_SOCKET_URL=wss://localhost:5000
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-stripe-public-key
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
   VITE_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your-google-recaptcha-site-key
   VITE_APP_ENABLE_CAPTCHA=true-or-false
   VITE_APP_OPENAI_KEY=your-openai-api-public-key
   
   ```

   Ensure all environment variables start with `VITE_` as this is required by Vite for client-side environment variables.

2. **Backend Environment Variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and include the following variables:

   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=development

   PORT=5000
   CLIENT_URL=https://localhost:5173
   GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=https://localhost:5000/api/auth/google/callback
   MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://

   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=15m
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=7d

   SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   SMTP_PORT=587
   EMAIL=yourbusinessemail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=yourID.apps.googleusercontent.com
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-yourID

   CSRF_SECRET=your_csrf_secret
   ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your_admin_secret_key
   SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
   RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your-recaptcha-site-key

   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your-stripe-secret-key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_PROD=whsec_your-stripe-webhook
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_DEV=whsec_your-stripe-webhook
   ```

   Adjust these variables as per your setup. Make sure to keep your `.env` files secure and avoid committing them to version control.

## Running the Project

Once you've installed the dependencies and set up your environment variables, you can run the project:

1. **Backend**:

   Navigate to the `server` directory and start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Frontend**:

   Navigate to the `client` directory and start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the frontend server on `http://localhost:5173`.

   Your application should now be up and running! You can access the frontend at `http://localhost:5173` and interact with the backend API at `http://localhost:5000/api`.
